/**
 * Text serialization — line endings that would make a blank line.
 *
 * Purpose: write a `text` node so that the line endings it carries come back
 * as text, never as block structure.
 *
 * Upstream writes a text line ending raw. One raw line ending is a soft break
 * and reads back as itself. But a line ending that starts the paragraph, ends
 * it, or sits directly beside another one makes a BLANK line, and a blank line
 * is structure: the parser drops it at a paragraph's edge and splits the
 * paragraph at one inside. In a list item the empty first line also means the
 * item "starts with a blank line", so a nested list below it can no longer
 * interrupt the paragraph and is read back as its text — found by the branch's
 * cross-model audit from `- b\n  1. &#10;x`. Such text only arrives through
 * character references, so it leaves through them.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Encode only the line endings that would make a blank line; a lone soft
 *     break, LF or CRLF, stays raw so ordinary documents do not change.
 *   - A post-pass on `state.safe`'s output, not an `unsafe` pattern: upstream's
 *     hard-break handler reads ANY `\n` pattern in scope as "line endings are
 *     not allowed here" and degrades every hard break to a space.
 *   - Spaces between two line endings need nothing here: upstream already
 *     encodes a space beside a line ending, and `&#x20;` is not blank.
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — installs this handler
 * @coordinates-with listInterruptJoin.ts — the other half of "a list item's
 *   first line must not be blank"
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/serializerText
