/**
 * Purpose: settle a backtick run that no later run can close in O(run length),
 * instead of letting micromark scan to the end of the paragraph to find that
 * out.
 *
 * micromark's `codeText` starts at a run of k backticks and consumes forward
 * until a run of EXACTLY k backticks, or the end of the paragraph. When no such
 * run exists it fails — and every other unmatched opener pays the same scan.
 * Runs of distinct lengths therefore cost O(openers × paragraph), which for
 * the soak's `backtick-runs` class is cubic in the number of runs: it had not
 * finished after twelve minutes at soak scale (#1407). cmark fixed the same
 * class by remembering, per run length, where the last such run was.
 *
 * So does this construct, registered ahead of `codeText`:
 *
 *   1. Until a memo exists, an opener scans exactly as far as `codeText` will:
 *      to its first closing run, or to the end of the paragraph. It records
 *      the start offset of the last run of each length on the way, and then
 *      defers, so `codeText` runs exactly as before. Only a scan that reached
 *      the end leaves its record behind as the memo.
 *   2. Every LATER opener of length k looks up the last run of length k. If it
 *      starts after the opener, `codeText` will close on some run of length k,
 *      so this defers. If not, `codeText` must fail, so the run is consumed as
 *      plain data — which is what the text tokenizer does with it anyway once
 *      `codeText` fails.
 *
 * Why never read further than `codeText`: a lookahead that crosses a line
 * ending reaches a chunk the subtokenizer has not written yet, and the
 * container skip it defines on the next line is then applied to the lookahead's
 * point instead of the real one. That moved a text node's end by a column in a
 * list continuation (audit counterexample: `*<TAB>` then two lines of code spans).
 * The skipped scans in step 2 cannot do the same: a memo exists only after a
 * scan reached the end, and by then every chunk and every skip is in place.
 *
 * Why the memo is exact: `codeText` closes on the first MAXIMAL run of exactly
 * the opener's length after the opener, and nothing inside a code span can end
 * it early. Runs after the opener are delimited by non-backtick characters, so
 * a scan from any earlier point segments them identically. The one run whose
 * segmentation can differ is the opener's own (after an escaped backtick), and
 * `start > opener` excludes it.
 *
 * `previous` is copied from `codeText` so this construct never changes which
 * characters the text tokenizer treats as a break. `inlineFastPaths.test.ts`
 * diffs the mdast, positions included, against the stock parser.
 *
 * @coordinates-with micromarkTypes.ts — the tokenizer API slice used here
 * @coordinates-with remarkInlineFastPaths.ts — registers this construct
