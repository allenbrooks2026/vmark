/**
 * Purpose: settle a `]` that nothing can close in O(1) amortized, instead of
 * letting micromark walk back through the whole paragraph to find that out.
 *
 * Two constructs are tried at every `]` in text, and both begin with a
 * backward scan over every event tokenized so far:
 *
 *   - `labelEnd` (micromark-core-commonmark) walks back to the nearest label
 *     start that is not yet balanced;
 *   - `gfmPotentialFootnoteCall` (micromark-extension-gfm-footnote) walks back
 *     to the nearest label image, link or footnote call.
 *
 * When the paragraph has no opener, both walks reach its start and fail — so
 * `a](` repeated n times costs O(n²). Measured at the soak's scale (#1407):
 * 60s to parse, and 276s to serialize, because the serializer's cosmetic pass
 * re-parses its output twice.
 *
 * This construct runs FIRST at `]`. It keeps an incremental index of the label
 * starts in the event list, and consumes the `]` as plain data exactly when no
 * unbalanced `labelLink`/`labelImage` exists. Both stock constructs must then
 * fail:
 *
 *   - `labelEnd` needs an unbalanced label start, by definition.
 *   - The potential footnote call needs a balanced `![` whose label, from the
 *     `![` to this `]`, names a defined footnote. A `![` is balanced only by a
 *     `]` that label-end tried and rejected — an unescaped `]` that is then
 *     INSIDE the label of every later `]`. A footnote definition label cannot
 *     contain an unescaped `]` (gfm's own definition tokenizer ends the label
 *     there), so no later `]` can complete that call. The one `]` that can is
 *     the one that balances the `![` — and at that `]` the `![` is still an
 *     unbalanced opener, so this construct defers.
 *
 * Anything else defers to the stock constructs, which then run exactly as
 * before. So the fast path can only make a parse FASTER; it cannot make one
 * different — `inlineFastPaths.test.ts` diffs the mdast, positions included,
 * against the stock parser over every vendored spec corpus, the spellings the
 * footnote argument has to survive, and a seeded fuzz.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - PROOF, NOT REIMPLEMENTATION. Resources, references, `_inactive` links,
 *     definitions — all of it stays in micromark. Only "can this `]` close
 *     anything at all?" is answered here, and only the NO answer is acted on.
 *   - WATCHES, NOT TRUST. A deferred `]` may let a stock construct succeed and
 *     splice the events from the label start it matched — label-end from the
 *     nearest unbalanced opener, the footnote call from that same `![`. Both
 *     resolvers put a NEW event at that index, so the index records the event
 *     there and re-indexes from it when it changes. Nothing else rewrites
 *     events below the scanned mark during text tokenization; a tail check
 *     backstops that claim by rebuilding from zero rather than trusting it.
 *   - UNKNOWN CONSTRUCTS DEFER. If anything but the two modelled constructs is
 *     registered at `]`, the fast path cannot prove inertness and never fires.
 *
 * Known limitation: when a candidate opener DOES exist, stock `labelEnd`
 * serializes the whole label text to look up a definition — O(label length)
 * per `]`, so `[` × n followed by `]` × n stays quadratic. That cost is the
 * lookup itself, not the scan, and removing it would mean changing which
 * labels can match a definition.
 *
 * @coordinates-with micromarkTypes.ts — the tokenizer API slice used here
 * @coordinates-with remarkInlineFastPaths.ts — registers this construct
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/parser/fastPaths/labelEndFastPath
