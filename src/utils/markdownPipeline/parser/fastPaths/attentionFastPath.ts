/**
 * Purpose: resolve `*`/`_` emphasis without walking every closer back to the
 * start of the paragraph.
 *
 * micromark resolves attention in one `resolveAll` pass: for every sequence
 * that can close, it walks back EVENT BY EVENT to the nearest sequence that can
 * open with the same marker (and passes the rule of three). A closer with
 * nothing to find walks all the way, so the cost is O(closers × events):
 *
 *   - `a_ ` × 24000, where every `_` closes and none opens: 27s to parse and
 *     44s to serialize at the soak's scale (#1407);
 *   - `*_` × 12000 `x` `_*` × 12000, where earlier matches CONSUME the only
 *     candidate openers, so two of every three closers walk to the start:
 *     117s to parse.
 *
 * This is micromark-core-commonmark 2.0.3's `resolveAllAttention`, ported with
 * one change: the walk. Instead of every event, a closer scans a per-marker
 * list of the opener sequences still present before it — exactly the events
 * the walk would stop at — nearest first, applying the stock test to each.
 * The match it finds, and everything done with it (the tokens, the points, the
 * inner span resolved through `insideSpan`, the splice, where the loop resumes)
 * is the stock code, line for line.
 *
 * Why the list is exact: an opener enters the list when the loop passes its
 * exit event, which it does for every event before a closer. A match removes
 * the opener if fully used and every list entry inside the matched span — the
 * span's sequences become data, and the stock walk would skip them. Entries
 * below the opener keep their indices: the splice starts at the opener.
 *
 * Mechanism: `attention` is disabled by name and this wrapper takes its place
 * at `*` and `_`. It tokenizes with micromark's own `attention` tokenizer,
 * looked up from the parser rather than imported. Link text inside a label is
 * still resolved by the stock resolver through `insideSpan`, as before.
 *
 * PLACE matters, unlike for the `]` and backtick fast paths: this wrapper
 * SUCCEEDS, so whichever construct micromark tries first at `_` wins. GFM's
 * email autolink is registered ahead of `attention` there, and a wrapper added
 * in front of both turned `(_A_@_.A` from a link into emphasis — the
 * equivalence test (`inlineFastPaths.test.ts`) caught exactly that. So the
 * wrapper is added AFTER, and refuses loudly to run anywhere but directly
 * behind the disabled stock construct, where the order of everything
 * micromark tries is unchanged.
 *
 * Known limitations: every match still re-resolves its inner span and splices
 * the event list, as stock does, so deeply NESTED matched emphasis stays
 * quadratic in its depth; and openers the rule of three skips are re-scanned by
 * each later closer, where cmark keeps a per-class floor.
 *
 * @coordinates-with micromarkTypes.ts — the tokenizer API slice used here
 * @coordinates-with remarkInlineFastPaths.ts — registers this construct
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/parser/fastPaths/attentionFastPath
