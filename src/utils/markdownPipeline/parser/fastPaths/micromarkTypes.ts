/**
 * Purpose: the slice of micromark's tokenizer API the inline fast paths touch,
 * declared locally, plus the one lookup they all need — "which constructs
 * would micromark try at this character?"
 *
 * Local rather than imported from `micromark-util-types`: that package is a
 * transitive dependency, and adding it to reach six interfaces would put a
 * version pin on the parser's internals for no runtime gain. These are
 * STRUCTURAL: a field micromark renames shows up as a fast path that stops
 * firing — which the scaling test catches — or one that fires wrongly — which
 * the equivalence test catches.
