/**
 * Blank line before a list that cannot interrupt a paragraph.
 *
 * Purpose: an mdast-util-to-markdown `join` that keeps a list from being read
 * back as the text of the paragraph above it.
 *
 * CommonMark §5.2: a list whose first item would start on a paragraph
 * continuation line may interrupt that paragraph only if the item does not
 * start with a blank line and, when ordered, starts at 1. Upstream joins the
 * children of a tight list item with no blank line, so a nested empty item
 * (`1. **b**\n   1.`) or a `3.` start became paragraph text on reparse — the
 * soak's editing fuzz lost an empty nested ordered item that way (#1407,
 * seed 3). Bullets obey the same rule: micromark tolerates `- b\n  -`, but a
 * CommonMark parser reads the `-` as a setext underline.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - Narrow by construction: the join says nothing unless the pair would
 *     break, so every list that can interrupt keeps its tight spelling.
 *   - An EMPTY paragraph writes no text and has nothing to interrupt.
 *   - A captured blank-line run (blankLinesJoin, ADR-1a) is honoured when it is
 *     at least one line; a captured 0 is raised to the 1 the list needs.
 *
 * @coordinates-with serializer.ts — registers this join after blankLinesJoin,
 *   so it is consulted first
 * @coordinates-with serializerHandlers.ts — blankLinesJoin, whose count it keeps
 * @module utils/markdownPipeline/listInterruptJoin
